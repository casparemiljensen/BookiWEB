Booki is based on the 3rd semester project of the Computer Science education at UCN.
The scope was to create a distributed system.
The BookiWeb app provides a platform for customers to book tables and table packages at venues(targeted Jomfru Ane Gade).
The BookiDesktop app provides a platform for employees/venue managers to handle reservations and table packages.
The BookiAPI enables the possibility to make the app a distributed system. Both the BookiWeb app and BookiDesktop app consumes this api.
